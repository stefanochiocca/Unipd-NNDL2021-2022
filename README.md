# Unipd-NNDL2021-2022
Homework for the Neural Networks and Deep Learning exam of 2021-2022 (UNIPD)

## Homework 1

The first homework required the implementation of a simple neural network to perform a regression and a classification task in a supervised learning setting. The network was implemented in PyTorch and the code is available in the `homework1` folder. The report is available in the `homework1/report` folder.

## Homework 2

The second homework required the implementation of an autoencoder to perform clustering in a unsupervised learning setting, and a GAN to learn about adversarial training. The network was implemented in PyTorch and the code is available in the `homework2` folder. The report is available in the `homework2/report` folder.

## Homework 3

The third homework explored the use of deep networks in reinforcement learning, by trying to beat the OpenAI games such as the inverted pendulum or the hill car. The network was implemented in PyTorch and the code is available in the `homework3` folder. The report is available in the `homework3/report` folder.
